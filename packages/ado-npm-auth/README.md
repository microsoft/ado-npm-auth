# Azure Devops NPM Auth

The `ado-npm-auth` package can automatically use the `azureauth` CLI to fetch tokens and update a user's `.npmrc` file for authenticating to ADO package feeds.

You'll first need an `.npmrc` in your project such as...

```text
registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/org/project/_packaging/feedname/npm/registry/
```

You can run the binary `"ado-npm-auth"` via `yarn ado-npm-auth` or `npm exec ado-npm-auth`.

It will then shell out to the `azureauth` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azureauth), retrieve a token, and update your `~/.npmrc`.

## ado-npm-auth vs vsts-npm-auth

The main difference between the two is how they function, and where they can run. The `vsts-npm-auth` tool is Windows only, and uses MSAL authentication.

`ado-npm-auth` uses the `node-azureauth` library, to wrap the [azureauth-cli](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli), which itself is a cross platform MSAL wrapper.

Since the `azureauth-cli` is cross-platform, `ado-npm-auth` will also run cross-platform as well!

One of the easiest ways to use the tool is to add it to your `"preinstall"` script in your repo like this...

```json
"scripts": {
  "preinstall": "npm exec ado-npm-auth"
},
```

It will then perform a quick "pre-flight" check to assess if the token is valid, and generate a new one if it has expired.

### authenticating a feed for the first time

`ado-npm-auth` by default runs on the assumption that a PAT exists on your devidce. 
If you haven't yet set up a PAT on your device (not authenticated your feed before), run the following command: 
```bash
npm exec ado-npm-auth -- --skip-check
```
This will set up a PAT in your root `.npmrc`, after which `npm exec ado-npm-auth` can be used to refresh the PAT when necessary.

> To view your root `.npmrc` run the command `npm config edit`
